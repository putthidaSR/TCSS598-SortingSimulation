# TCSS598-SortingSimulation

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to run a simulation experiment on large unsorted data sets using different sorting algorithms. We implement five different sorting mechanisms including insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort. For each sorting algorithm, we analyze its performance and runtime complexity based on different input data sets. In this report, we will also discuss the differences between each sorting technique, and when to use each technique according to the result of performance curves conduct from this experiment. The final point of this report will discuss the usage of insertion index for measure of sortedness.
